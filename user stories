The User Stories (30)
Epic 1: The Unified Dashboard & Discovery

As a Superfan, I want a unified dashboard so that I can see live results for F1 and MotoGP on the same screen.

As a user, I want to filter the race calendar by discipline (e.g., Jet Racing only) so I don't see irrelevant events.

As a fan, I want to "Follow" specific riders/drivers to receive personalized news alerts.

As a user, I want a "Global Search" to find specific tracks, riders, or engine specs across all sports.

As a mobile user, I want a simplified "Live View" so I can track race positions while away from my TV.

As a fan, I want a "Timezone Toggle" so that all race start times are automatically converted to my local time.

Epic 2: Live Telemetry & Real-time Data

As a Data Nerd, I want to see live telemetry (speed, gear, throttle) for F1 cars so I can analyze driving styles.

As a Bettor, I want sub-second latency on race updates so I have the most accurate data for live predictions.

As a Gearhead, I want to see tire degradation stats during a MotoGP race to understand pit strategies.

As a user, I want to see a live "Gap to Leader" visualization that updates every second.

As a Jet Racing fan, I want to track the altitude and G-force of pilots during live air races.

As a technical user, I want to view historical telemetry logs to compare a rider’s performance across different years.

Epic 3: Engineering & Tech Corner

As a Gearhead, I want a "Bike/Car Comparison" tool to see technical specs side-by-side.

As a student, I want to read "Technical Explainers" on aero-winglets or hybrid engines to learn the science behind the speed.

As a user, I want to see 3D models of engines with annotated parts for different racing classes.

As a fan, I want to see "Track Profiles" that highlight technical challenges like elevation changes and braking zones.

Epic 4: Community & Gamification

As a fan, I want to join "Paddock Chat" rooms for specific races to discuss the action with others.

As a user, I want to participate in "Podium Predictions" to earn badges and climb a global leaderboard.

As a fan, I want to share specific data visualizations (like a lap-time graph) directly to social media.

As a user, I want to vote on "Driver of the Day" during the final laps of a race.

Epic 5: Backend & Performance (Golang Specific)

As a Developer, I want to use Goroutines to ingest data from 10+ different racing APIs simultaneously without blocking the main thread.

As a Developer, I want to implement a WebSocket server in Go to push real-time telemetry to thousands of users at once.

As a Developer, I want to build a high-speed caching layer (using Redis) to serve frequently accessed standings in under 10ms.

As a Developer, I want to implement gRPC for internal microservices to ensure fast communication between the news and telemetry modules.

As a Developer, I want to write unit tests in Go for the data-parsing logic to ensure race results are never corrupted during ingestion.

As a Developer, I want to use Go's context package to handle API timeouts gracefully during peak race traffic.

Epic 6: Administration & Security

As an Admin, I want a CMS dashboard to quickly update race results if an official penalty changes the standings.

As an Admin, I want to moderate community forums to remove toxic content or spoilers.

As a user, I want to log in using OAuth (Google/Discord) so I don't have to create another password.

As a security officer, I want all API endpoints rate-limited to prevent scraping bots from slowing down the site during a race.
